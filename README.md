### MAZE RUNNERS
A maze escape game based on the Greek myth of the minotaur trapped in the labyrinth by Daedalus who is portrayed as the main enemy in the story progression. The game features a procedural maze-generation algorithm that produces a random unique maze at every level and increases in size and difficulty as the game progresses. The player must collect an increasing number of keys as the levels progress in order to exit the maze while avoiding drone and spike enemies that roam around the maze. Thankfully, the minotaur has access to special items like a teleporter, wall-breaker, speed boost, and little chickies friends that demonstrate A* pathfinding in order to navigate through the maze quicker and avoid enemies. You only have three lives, so be careful!

### HOW TO RUN THE GAME
After cloning the repository, if you have CMAKE installed, it should automatically build the game based on your local file directory, open up main.cpp and
run the game. The main menu should appear; the tutorial will teach you the fundamentals of the game, and then once you have completed that, choose START GAME to begin playing the full game! The OPTIONS button is more of a development tool where a few pre-built maps can be chosen to play from. You can also load a saved game from a previous play.
